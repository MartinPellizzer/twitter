You grow when surrounded by rolling fields and fresh air, not trapped in concrete jungles. Embrace the simplicity, serenity, and self-sufficiency of rural living.

You know you're living the good life when the morning alarm is replaced by birdsong, not car horns.

You find perspective when gazing at a star-filled sky, not at a small glowing screen. 

You recharge your soul when listening to the gentle melodies of birdsong, not to the blaring sounds of traffic.

Be the reason someone understands that talent can open doors, but skill is what keeps them from closing.

Admitting that perfectionism can be a roadblock to productivity...
Admitting that breaks are essential for productivity...
Admitting that technology can be a double-edged sword...
Admitting that saying "no" is crucial for productivity...

Humility is so undervalued. Funny how most people mistake this strength as a weakness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Success requires sacrifice.

You must be willing to let go of old habits, comfort zones, and even certain relationships to make room for growth and progress.

It's not always easy, but the rewards of success far outweigh the temporary discomfort of sacrifice.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

People with high emotional intelligence are so rare. When you find them, never let them go.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lack of assertiveness (or people pleasing).

There's no secret to solving it. Just push yourself slightly over the edge day by day. Slowly desensitize.

Never take a big leap. You will get traumatized and sooner go back to old schemes.

Just have discipline and patience.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apologizing without changing behavior is just lying. Beware of manipulators.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't chase people. Chase your purpose. Then people will start chasing you.

7 Productivity Hacks No Overwhelmed Solopreneur Can Afford to Ignore

# thread
I've read "The Power of Discipline" so you don't have to.

Here are the top 7 lessons I learned:

1) Discipline is a skill, not a talent

No one's born disciplined. We all learn it. It's something we develop through consistent practice and determination. So stop making excuse, and start train.

2) Focus on the journey, not the destination

When you focus on the journey, you find joy in the process and appreciation for the present. The journey is where you develop resilience, gain wisdom, and find your true purpose.

3) Willpower and fatigue are worst enemies

Remember to prioritize self-care, rest, and rejuvenation to keep fatigue at bay. When your fatigue level increases, your willpower level lower.

4) Discipline and confidence go together

Confidence without competence is just arrogance. Faking confidence may work in the short term, but will totally fail in the long term. Master skills if you want real, genuine, and lasting confidence.

5) You train discipline like you train a muscle

You either grow or shrink. Status-quo is a myth. The more you train discipline, the easier it gets. The less your train it, the harder it gets. It's either a virtuous or vicious cycle. You choose.

6) Avoiding distractions is better than fighting them

Discipline is like motivation: limited. The more you are tempted with easy pleasure, the harder it becomes to resist. You may have a strong will, but you are not a saint. Desing a destraction-free environment. Prevention is the best cure.

7) Be disciplined, even with your breaks

Taking breaks is not wasting time, it's investing time. Keep your energy levels high if you want to stay productive. A tired mind is not a productive mind. Burnouts are not fun to deal with.
